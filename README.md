(3 points) Run the program on GCP to solve the case k = 7.
Provide xS, its hash value, the total time elapsed, and the number of trials.
Describe your cluster's configuration (number of machines, number/type of cores, etc.) and your process for estimating the number of trials needed in order to find the nonce.
(3 points) Modify one line of code in src/main/scala/project_1/main.scala so that the program generates the potential nonce from 1 to n (the number of trials) instead of randomly.
Discuss whether or not this is more efficient than the randomized approach.

## Question 1
(4 points) Run the program on your local machine to solve cases k = 2,3,4,5,6.
For each k, provide xS, its hash value, the total time elapsed, and the number of trials.
